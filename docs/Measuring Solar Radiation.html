<h1>Measuring Solar Radiation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Industrial grade devices for measuring solar radiation are
delicate and expensive. The "pyranometer" is basically a flat
plate (covered with a transparent dome) that is
coated with an extremely absorptive surface. As the sun strikes
it, the surface gets hot. The temperature of the surface is
measured with a thermopile, giving an output voltage related
to the amount of solar radiation striking the surface.

</p><p>You can build a "poor man's" pyranometer that works pretty well
out of inexpensive and readily available components. Although it
will not be of laboratory quality, it will suffice for comparative
measurements and educational purposes.

</p><h2>Making the Meter</h2>

<p>The obvious component to consider as the basis for our
meter is a silicon photovoltaic cell. When sunlight strikes
it, it produces electricity, and the more sunlight strikes
it, the more electricity it produces.

</p><p>At first glance, you might think that you could just hook a
voltmeter up to it and measure the output voltage. Unfortunately,
if you do this, you will get very erroneous results (visit the
Appendix if you want to understand why).

</p><p>Instead, you will need to measure the cell's output current.
If you short out (hook a perfect wire between) the positive and
negative terminals of your cell, a current flows through that
wire. That is the current that you would like to measure. It
varies linearly with the amount of sunlight striking the surface
of the cell. This
is actually a little trickier than one might think, for reasons
that are explained in the Appendix. 

</p><p>You can measure the cell's current by measuring the voltage
across a very small resistor. Here we show how to do this with
a digital panel meter or digital VOM. This is shown in the following
schematic:<br><br>

</p><p></p><center>

</center>

<p>PV represents the PV cell, and M represents the voltmeter.
Rsh is the resistor through which most of the current from the
PV flows, and across which we will measure the voltage.

</p><p>Following are the steps in making the meter.
</p><ul>

<li>Our goal is to make full sunlight give a 100 mVolt reading
on the digital meter (full sunlight is about 1000 watts per square
meter), so our meter will read 1 mVolt per 10 Watts/m2. 

</li><li>Get a 3 1/2 digit digital panel meter (try 
<a href="http://www.mpja.com/">Marlin P. Jones</a>,
which sells such things for about $7...they do require a battery)
that has a 0-199.9 mVolt scale (this is a common item). Or, just
plan on using a digital multimeter on the 0-200 mVolt scale.

</li><li>First, estimate how much current your cell will produce in
full sunlight. A good first assumption is that your cell puts
out about 0.025 amps per square centimeter. So measure your cell,
calculate its area, and multiply by 0.025. For example,
if your cell is 8 cm square, guess that your full sunlight cell current is
8 * 8 * 0.025 = 1.6 amps.

</li><li>Calculate the resistance that is required to give 100 mVolt
drop when I is flowing through it. Ohms law says that R = V / I,
or 0.1 volt / I. For our example, this is 0.1 Volts / 1.6 Amp, 
or 0.0625 ohms.

</li><li>Make the resistor. For very small resistors like this, a
good way is to use a length of small wire. I used number 30
wire wrap wire. Appendix B shows the resistance per foot for
various small copper wire sizes. Number 30 wire has a resistance
of about 0.121 ohms per foot. So, to make a 0.0625 ohm resistor,
only requires 0.52 feet, or 6.2 inches!

</li><li>Connect your resistor across the PV cell. You will need to
solder it, because of the very low resistances involved. And,
bear in mind that wiring connected to the cell also has resistance,
so either account for it or cut it short.

</li></ul>

<p>At this point, you should be able to connect your digital meter
across the terminals. It should be configured for 200 millivolts
full scale. Note that because the meter is measuring voltage now,
the length of your meter wires is not too important. If you take
your apparatus out into full sunlight, you will hopefully see
a reading on your meter that is not too far from 100 mVolts.

</p><p>At this point, you will want to calibrate your meter. The
best way is to have a calibrated instrument of some sort.
Lacking this, you do a fair job by finding a
time when the sun is high (noon on a summer day) on a
very clear day. Then assume that the solar radiation is
1000 watts per square meter.

</p><p>The following steps show how to calibrate the meter by
altering your resistor. It will assume that you are calibrating
without a reference. If you have an actual reference instrument,
then use whatever value it supplies instead of 1000.

</p><ul>
<li>In full sunlight, note the reading of your meter. We would
like for it to be exactly 100 mVolts. It is probably something 
different. 
</li><li>We are going to make a new resistor wire of the proper length to
make the meter read 100 mVolts.
</li><li>Calculate Lnew = L0 * 100 / reading. (L0 is the original length of
the resistor wire). For example if my original wire was 6.2
inches, and my meter reads 88, I need a new resistor wire of
length Lnew = 6.2 * 100 / 88 = 7.05 inches.
</li><li>Cut a new resistor wire and replace your original.
</li></ul>

<p>At this point, your silicon solar
cell and digital voltmeter should be doing a fair job
of measuring solar radiation.

</p><h2>Things to do With Your Meter</h2>

<p>Here are some interesting experiments to do using your
meter.

</p><ul>
<li>Check the effect of angle of incidence. Point the cell directly
at the sun and measure output. Then turn the cell at various
angles, and see how the "angle of incidence" affects output.
Theory says that direct radiation striking the surface is proportional
to the cosine of the angle of incidence.

</li><li>Experiment with measuring direct versus diffuse radiation. 

<p>Sunshine consists of the rays that come straight from
the sun (direct radiation) plus light that has been reflected
from air molecules, dust in the atmosphere, etc.
</p><ul>
<li>Set the PV cell on a horizontal surface. You are measuring
Global Horizontal radiation.
</li><li>While the cell is sitting on a horizontal surface, cast a shadow
on in with your hand, held several feet away. You have shaded
the direct radiation, and what is left is the diffuse radiation.
Compare this to the global horizontal.

</li><li>Get a mailing tube mount the PV cell to it, so that
the cell's surface is perpendicular to the length of the tube.
Point the assembly at the sun. You are measuring "direct"
solar radiation.

</li></ul>

</li><li>measure the energy striking the outside of a window.

</li><li>Put the cell flat against the inside of a window.
<ul>
	<li>How does the radiation measured here compare to that
measured on the outside of the window.
	</li><li>You are measuring radiant energy that will warm your house.
In the winter, this is free heat. In the summer, you don't want
it. 
	</li><li>Compare the results for different windows of your house,
and consider the relationship between this radiant gain and
the amount of sky that your window sees.
</li></ul>

</li><li>measure the effectiveness of shade cloth
<ul>
	<li>measure how much radiation is transmitted through the
shade cloth.
	</li><li>Turn the cell upside down, hold it above the shade cloth,
and measure the amount of
radiation reflected back from the shade cloth.
	</li><li>Do the same experiment with black and with white
	shade cloth. Which is likely to result in a cooler patio?
</li></ul>
</li><li>Investigate the effects of surface reflectance on road,
sidewalk, and driveway heating.
<ul>
<li>Using the upside down cell, measure the amount of reflected
radiation from various surfaces.
</li><li>How does this compare with the temperature of the surface?
</li></ul>
</li><li>Compare sunlight to strong artificial light.
</li><li>Compare the reading some distance from an incandescant light
to that of a compact flourescent light of the same lumens
rating, the same distance away. Is there a difference? Can
you explain why there might be a difference?
</li></ul>

<h2>Appendix A: The I-V Characteristic of PV cells</h2>

<h3>Basic Electricity</h3>

<p>Remember that voltage and current are not the same. Voltage
represents the strength of the electricity, analogous to water
pressure (say, in pounds per square inch). Current represents the
flow rate, analogous to water flow rate (say, in gallons per second).
The units of voltage are Volts. The units of current are Amps. 

</p><p>A Resistor is a device that resists the flow of electricity.
Its behavior s governed by Ohm's Law, which says that the voltage
across a resistor (in Ohms) is equal to the Current (in Amps)
flowing through it times the Voltage across it. Note that current
is always through an element, and voltage is always across an element.

</p><p>A Current Source is an element that delivers a constant
current, regardless of the voltage across it. It is an ideal
element that is approached by certain circuits over certain
operational ranges.

</p><p>A Voltage Source is an element that delivers a constant
voltage at its terminals. Like a Current Source, it is an
ideal device, approached over particular operating ranges by
real devices.

</p><h3>PV Cells</h3>

<p>Over part of its operating region, PV cells act like
a current source. Over part of their region, they act like
a voltage source. The following figure is what is known as an
I-V curve. It shows how current and voltage relate to each
other in a typical PV cell. Each of the colored lines describes
behavior at one level of incoming radiation.

<img src="./Measuring Solar Radiation_files/pviv.gif" alt="I-V Curve" border="0">

</p><p>Note that when voltage is very low, the cell acts like a current
source. That is, it delivers a rather constant current, independent
of the voltage. 

</p><p>The point at which the I/V curve intersects the vertical
axis is called the "short circuit current", or Isc. Isc is
directly proportional to the solar radiation striking the cell.
If you could short out the cell and measure the current,
your reading would be proportional to the incoming radiation.

</p><p>The point at which the curve intersects the horizontal axis
corresponds to what a voltmeter (which takes its reading without
drawing hardly any current) will read if connected to a PV cell.
It is called the Open Circuit Voltage, or Voc. Voc is NOT
proportional to to incoming radiation.

</p><h3>Pitfalls</h3>

<p>To use a PV cell to measure solar radiation, you want
to measure its current output. Ideally, a current meter
would have zero resistance. In reality, they all have some
resistance. Here we investigate the effect of current
meter resistance on our measurement.

</p><p>In addition to the PV cell I/V curves, the above graph
shows I/V curves for three different resistors, 0.0667 ohms,
0.4 ohms, and 1.5 ohms (note how it obeys Ohm's Law). If
a resistor is connected across the terminals of a PV cell,
the operating point will be described by the intersection
of the resistor's line and the PV cell's curve (for the
current incoming radiation).

</p><p>Note how for the smallest resistor, the points of intersection
fall along the constant current portion of the PV cell's
characteristic. So, the current through the resistor is
proportional to the incoming radiation.

</p><p>For the other resistors, though, we are not operating
within the constant current region, so the current through
our load will NOT be proportional to the incoming radiation.

</p><p>My first attempt at measuring PV current was using a
digital Volt/Amp/Ohmmeter, set to the current scale.
I got totally crazy results, with a mostly shaded cell
showing nearly as much output as an unshaded cell.
Investigation showed that the resistance of the ammeter
was over 2 ohms, which was drastically altering the
result.

</p><p>If you are going to use a silicon PV cell for measuring
solar radiation you MUST first consider the resistance of
your current measuring circuit, making sure that it is low
enough to be mostly in the constant current region of the
cell. The method described above limits PV output voltage to
about 0.4 volts, which keeps the measurement reasonably linear
with radiation variation.

</p><h2>Deficiencies in this Measurement Device</h2>
<p>A pyranometer based on silicon cells is not a
laboratory device. A good pyranometer has a very flat
spectral response. This means that it responds equally
to all wavelengths that strike it. Silicon photocells
tend to have an irregular spectral response, responding
less well to longer wavelength photons. Below a certain
wavelength in the infrared, they cease to respond at
all.
</p><p>In spite of the limitations, the simple device shown here
is useful as a learning tool.
