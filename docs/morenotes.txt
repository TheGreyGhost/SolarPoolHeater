testing of ethernet connection:
28-10-2018
works fine in both directions

test using
nc -u -l 53201   (listen on port 53201)
and
nc -u 192.168.2.35 53201 (send to 192.168.2.35:53201)

Commands are received by either Serial (in tickCommands) or Ethernet (tickEthernet which calls Commands::parseIncomingInput)
Commands must have ! as the starting character

to test: Commands::parseIncomingInput
