testing of ethernet connection:
28-10-2018
works fine in both directions

test using
nc -u -l 53201   (listen on port 53201)
and
nc -u 192.168.2.35 53201 (send to 192.168.2.35:53201)

Commands are received by either Serial (in tickCommands) or Ethernet (tickEthernet which calls Commands::parseIncomingInput)
Commands must have ! as the starting character

There are two Ethernet channels - terminal, and datastream
terminal is the same as the serial terminal

datastream uses the following protocol:

incoming command:
!s = request current sensor information
!p = request parameter information
!l{dword row nr}{word count} = request entries from log file
!n = request number of entries in log file
!c = cancel transmissions (log file)

response:
!l{byte version} then

for sensor:

for parameter:

for logfile:
!l -> the byte stream from the log file itself
!n -> dword number of entries in log file

The final byte in the packet is {byte status: 0 = ok, else error code}
Each response is a single UDP packet only.

Currently up to: 
  working on the datastream commands
